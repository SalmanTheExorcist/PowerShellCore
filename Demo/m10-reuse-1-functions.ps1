  Notes on this script

  As you get comfortable writing reusable functions, you will want to place
  them in one or more scripts you can call over and over again. In this
  file, we'll create a simple function you can call. 

  In the script m10-reuse-2-calling-a-script.ps1, we'll show how to execute
  this script of functions so that the functions will be in memory for you
  to use.
