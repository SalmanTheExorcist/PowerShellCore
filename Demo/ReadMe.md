# Demos
This folder contains the demo files that were used in my Pluralsight course PowerShell Core for Linux and macOS. Much of the code was also used in part or whole during live training events such as conferecnes.

The PowerShell script files were named using the format mxx-title.ps1, where xx represents the module number and title reflects the subject matter for that module. Note that module 1 was simply the course introduction, with no code. 

For modules 2 and 3, viewers were stepped through the installation of PowerShell Core, VSCode, and other components, and thus no PowerShell scripts were used. You can, however, find detailed notes on the manual installation process in the Notes project folder. 

Note, the m11-install-docker.sh script is used as part of the m11-cool-things-1-docker demo.

The DebugLog.sql file as well as TeenyTinyDB.bacpac were used in the m11-cool-things-2-azure demo.
