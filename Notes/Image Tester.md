# Testing Images

Just ignore this for the time being, I'm testing to see how various extensions as well as the git site handle embedded images. 

Here is an embedded image, ammie01
<img src="ammie01.jpg" width=320 height=240>
How was that

Trying again with path for ammie 02
<img src="Images/ammie02.JPG" width=320 height=240>
