# Extras
After you are comfortable with setting up your machine manually, it is likely you will want to automate that process. The shell scripts in this folder will automate the installation of PowerShell Core, VSCode, Azure Data Studio, Docker and other tools used in this Pluralsight course. 

These scripts will make it very easy to setup a new virtual machine to learn on. They could also be used as the basis for developing your own setup scripts for new machines (virtual or otherwise).

Each script contains extensive commenting, make sure you read and understand each script before executing it. Never trust scripts from the internet, including mine, until you have reviewed them and fully understand their functions.
